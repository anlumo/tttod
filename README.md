# To the Temple of Doom!

This is an adaptation of the game by that name by Storybrewers Roleplaying available for free [here](https://storybrewersroleplaying.com/temple-of-doom/) to the web.

It allows a group of people to play the game online (voicechat is also necessary but not provided). So, this is not a game by itself, just a tool that manages the hidden information needed for playing, and also keeping track of the character stats and conditions.

## How to install

There is no convenient way to deploy the system currently, but that might come later. The application comes in two parts, the client side and the server side. Both are written in Rust, but the client side is compiled to Web Assembly, so it can be run in any modern web browser.

### Server Side

You need to install the Rust environment, for example via [rustup](https://rustup.rs). Then navigate to the root directory of this project and enter

```sh
cargo run
```

It will take care of downloading all dependencies, building the binary for the current platform and running it. Note that there is a config file called `config.yaml` you might need to edit. The program also accepts a limited amount of command line flags, you can find out more by running

```sh
cargo run -- --help
```

### Client Side

In addition to the Rust environment mentioned in the previous section, you also need to install `npm` for building the frontend. After you have done so, navigate to the `tttod_frontend` directory and enter

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

This will run the development environment (and also install the dependencies and compile the Rust part). Creating the files for web server deployment can be done with

```sh
npm run-script build
```

### Deployment

The backend can serve the static files as well. When you run

```sh
npm run-script build
```

to build the frontend, the static files are stored in `tttod_frontend/dist`. Copy the content of this directory to wherever you want to serve the files from. Then edit `config.yaml` to point to that directory (`server.static_path`).

## Using the System

Most of the things should be self-explanatory and most of the text is included on the web pages anyways, but it helps to read the original rules in full to know what's going on (it's not a long document anyways). If you navigate to the main path of the web site, you can enter a game name. Every player who enters the same name will participate in the same game. You need 3 to 5 players to proceed, and the server does verify this number.
